I usually was using a Rasberry Pi 2 running DietPI to run simple scripts like this to update my IP address and more but I found during my house move that I was only able to setup my Desktop PC and this meant sometimes servers were running for me but their DDNS was not. 

To combat this, I built this application that could run on my host machine to automatically update the IP of a given DDNS domain or group while running my servers also.
